# Pac-Man-JS
Recreation of the classic arcade Pac-Man game in JavaScript

**JavaScript concepts used**
- event listeners
- query selectors
- array manipulation
- DOM manipulation
- Classes & constructors
- Intervals & Timeouts

**Possible Improvements**
- Overall UI can be improved with animations, proper Icons for the characters & map tiles, sound effects, etc.
- Adding ai pathing for the ghosts. Currently the ghosts only move randomly which makes the game incredibly easy.
